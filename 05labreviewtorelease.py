Instructions: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.

In this recitation you are to write 5 functions. The only code you should write
is in the five places marked "WRITE YOUR CODE HERE." The rest of the code is
to set up and test the code you write. You should of course try different test cases,
but several are written here.

I describe each of them below, and give test code and a header for each
Your task is to make them work as described


To endble the test code for each task, change the booleans below. When you are
working on one task you may want to disable the others.

#----------------TASK 5
"""
Your task here is to code a function that creates a multidimensional array and initializes it.

Your function should look like this:
def makeDDimensionalArray(d,n,f)
(hint: you may need to add other parameters, but give them default values)

n: This is the size in each dimension.
d: This is the number of dimensions
f: This is the function called to initialize the array. It should work as
follows: suppose you have a 3-D array, call it A and you need to initilize
A[i][j][k]. You shoud set it to f( (i,j,k) ).

For example, to create a 2D 5x5 array where A[i][j]=i+j you would call:
checkAnswer(makeDDimensionalArray(2,5,sum)
and this should return:
[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]]

As another example, to create a 4D 2x2x2x2 array, all of ones, you would call:

checkAnswer(makeDDimensionalArray(4,2,always1)
and ti would return
[[[[1, 1], [1, 1]], [[1, 1], [1, 1]]], [[[1, 1], [1, 1]], [[1, 1], [1, 1]]]]
where always1 is the function defined below that always returns 1

Hint 1: Recursion
Hint 2: My answer is one line long. Yours should not be very long.
